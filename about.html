             <h1>About</h1>
          <p><A HREF="http://www.palmbeachpost.com" target="_blank">The Palm Beach Post</A> derives these restaurant inspection reports from bulk data published by the <A HREF="http://www.myfloridalicense.com/dbpr/hr/inspections.html" target="_blank">Florida Department of Business & Professional Regulation</A>, which inspects food service operations in restaurants, hotels and amusement parks, as well as food trucks.</p>
		  
		  Several types of reports are available:<ul>
		  <li> All inspections, showing all inspections over a substantial amount of time.
		  <li> Newly licensed restaurants, which includes both truly new restaurants and new ownership.
		  <li> Perfect inspections, or restaurants that have had a perfect inspection on the latest visit, which was not a follow-up from earlier problems.
		  <li> Bad inspections, showing restaurant inspections for places that have been ordered to close or had a larger number of high-priority violations. Roughly one-sixth of inspections show four or more high-priority violations.
		  </ul>
		  
		  <p>You can zoom in and out on the map and scroll around. Additionally, you can limit searches by region. "West" shows restaurants near Lake Okeechobee. "North" begins close to Martin Luther King and Blue Heron boulevards. The line between "Central" and "South" falls near Miner Road, between Gateway Boulevard and Hypoluxo Road.</p>
		  
		  <p>Suggestions and questions may be sent to The Palm Beach Post's data reporter, Mike Stucka, at <A HREF="email:mstucka@pbpost.com">mstucka@pbpost.com</A></p>.
